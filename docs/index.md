We are a group of graduate students currently studying at University of Glasgow. This is our course project for Real-Time Embedded Programming Project advised by Dr. Bernd Porr and Dr. Nicholas Bailey. For our team, two members major in Robotics & Ai, one member majors in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.<br>

Our project, Cycle Buddy, is a system that detects cars that endanger the bikers on the road. Once the car overpasses our biker in a relative high speed and within a close distance, the system can detect this dangerous action and responds by capturing the car's photo and recognize its car plate number. Then it will send the id, the photo and the velocity& distance to the mobile application as long as the online database. With those infomation recorded as evidence, the bikers can then use it to contact local law enforcement to report the issue. <br />

## Short demo about our project
<br>
The Gif below demonstrates the real time nature of the system, where each sensor reading is sent to the android application and plotted in real time:

* It is clear to note how the timestamp emerging from the raspberry pi is the same as the one displayed in the android app. This reinforces the real-time responsiveness of our system.
