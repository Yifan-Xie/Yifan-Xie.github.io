We are a group of the Real Time Embedded Programing Project in the University of Glasgow.  Two members major in Robotics & Ai, one member majors in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.<br>

Our project, Cycle Buddy, is a system that detects danger levels in bikers relative to drivers. Once a driver overpasses a biker, the system detects this unauthorised act, and responds by recognising the face/car plate of the driver in order to contact law enforcements. <br />
