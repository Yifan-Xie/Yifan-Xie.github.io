We are a group of graduate students currently studying at University of Glasgow. This is our course project for Real-Time Embedded Programming Project advised by Dr. Bernd Porr and Dr. Nicholas Bailey. For our team, two members major in Robotics & Ai, one member majors in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.<br>

## Short demo about our project
<br>
The Gif below demonstrates the real time nature of the system, where each sensor reading is sent to the android application and plotted in real time:

* It is clear to note how the timestamp emerging from the raspberry pi is the same as the one displayed in the android app. This reinforces the real-time responsiveness of our system.
