Our project, Cycle Buddy, is a system that detects cars that endanger the bikers on the road. Once the car overpasses our biker in a relative high speed and within a close distance, the system can detect this dangerous action and responds by capturing the car's photo and recognize its car plate number. <br>

Then it will send the id, the photo and the velocity& distance to the mobile application as long as the online database. With those infomation recorded as evidence, the bikers can then use it to contact local law enforcement to report the issue. <br />
