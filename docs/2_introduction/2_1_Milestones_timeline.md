    The first two weeks, we make a plan to decide what to do for the project and which type of         sensors we should choose. <br>
    Week 3 and 4, we test the sensors and finish the unit test for Hall sensor,  ultrasonic sensor     and Pi camera, which we select to use in the project. <br>
    Then, we spend a lot of time realizing and intergrating the functions, and link them to the       API, firebase and our Android Application. <br>
