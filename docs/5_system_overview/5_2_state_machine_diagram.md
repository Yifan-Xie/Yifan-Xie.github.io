In the state machine above:
<br><br>

* Dis_t is the relative disatnce threshold (max.) between car and bike that triggers photo capture.
<br>

* Vel_t is the relative speed threshold (min.) between car and bike that triggers photo capture.
<br>

* Vb_t is the threshold speed of bike which ensure that when photo capture is triggerer, the bike is moving with a minimum speed, instead of being pushed or stand still.
