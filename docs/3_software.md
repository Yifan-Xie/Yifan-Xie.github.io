## Software

### Necessary:
* [**Android Studio**](https://developer.android.com/studio)	(**Mobile Phone Application**) 

  ​	Android Studio provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device. We use it for connecting the raspberry pi and get real-time information from the raspberry pi, such as car distance, car velocity, and bike velocity.

* [**Visual Studio 2019**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/vs/)    (**Raspberry pi threads**) 

  ​	Visual Studio 2019 has the latest features to bring real-time collaboration so it is convenient for us to write C++ code for their project.

* [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/)    (**Real time database**) 

  ​	Firebase is Google’s mobile application development platform that helps you build, improve, and grow your app. It manages our data and stores our license plate numbers which are from the Pi camera.

* [**Cmake**](https://cmake.org/)    (**Build up the full project**) 

  ​	CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of our choice.

* [**Doxygen**](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html)    (**document generation tool**) 

  ​	Doxygen is a document generation tool that extracts documents from code, organizes them, and outputs them into beautiful documents (HTML, PDF, RTF, etc.).

  ​	With the Doxygen tool, programmers can write code directly in the document, no longer need to write a separate document for a function of the code, thus keeping the document and code as consistent as possible.

*  [**OpenALPR - Automatic License Plate Recognition**](https://www.openalpr.com/) (**API**)

  ​	This API can recognize the license plate number directly from the picture, we find a GB (Great Britain, UK) lib trained model and use it.

### Optional: 
* Putty

  ​	Find the IP address of raspberry pi simply. 

* VNC (Other Remote Desktop Services are also fine) 

  ​	Use ssh services to log in to the raspberry pi so that we do not need to use HDMI or screen to connect to the raspberry pi. It is also convenient to use UI to code in raspberry pi.

*  Typora 

  ​	Edit markdown and Html files for Doxygen and web page.

* [**Search for the car information**](https://vehicleenquiry.service.gov.uk/?_ga=2.97692959.1629293611.1618412250-1021591735.1618412250)

  ​	Here is the government website to search for the car information, so when we get the license plate number, we can search for it here.
